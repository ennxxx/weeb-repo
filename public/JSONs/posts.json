    "author": "64bbce8c9e08a4493219f460",
    "content": "Despite its visually stunning animation and action sequences, Demon Slayer fails to explore significant thematic depth. It primarily focuses on the battle between good and evil, neglecting opportunities to delve into complex societal, moral, or philosophical themes. The absence of deeper thematic exploration prevents it from resonating on a profound and thought-provoking level. So why did I watch it? Inosuke.",

    "title": "Should I play Genshin again?",
    "author": "64bbce8c9e08a4493219f466",
    "content": "Lately, I've been stumbling upon tons of Genshin-related stuff like MMDs, fan comics, breathtaking artwork, and mind-blowing MVs featuring the characters on YouTube. It's rekindling my interest like never before!\n\nTo give you some background, I gave Genshin a shot last year but ended up dropping it because I was also engrossed in playing Honkai Impact (which I still do, by the way). Back then, I thought managing the gacha systems in both games would be overwhelming, not to mention the occasional negativity aimed at Genshin players. However, things have changed for me now.\n\nRecently, I've been bombarded with a flood of amazing Genshin content, and it's making me seriously consider jumping back into the game. The only thing that's giving me second thoughts is the game's free-to-play aspect. How feasible is it to enjoy the game without spending a fortune? Is Genshin Impact worth giving another shot?",

        "content": "Just do it my friend. I've been playing Genshin since launch and I've never spent a single cent on it. I'm currently AR 55 and I have 3 5-star characters and 2 5-star weapons. I'm not even a hardcore player. I just play for 1-2 hours a day. The game is very generous with its primogems and you can get a lot of free stuff from events. The only thing you need to do is to manage your resources well. Don't waste your primogems on the standard banner. Save them for the limited banners. Also, don't waste your fragile resin. Use them only when you need to. If you're not in a hurry to get to the endgame, you can just take your time and enjoy the game. There's no need to rush. The game is still in its early stages and there's a lot of content coming in the future. If you're a fan of open-world RPGs, you'll definitely enjoy Genshin. The game is beautiful and the story is great. The characters are also very lovable. I highly recommend it. I hope you give it another shot. Good luck and have fun!",

It can also learn a lot of moves like Leaf Blade, Dragon Claw, and Earthquake. It's also a good pokemon to use in Minecraft because it can cut down trees with its Leaf Blade move.",
