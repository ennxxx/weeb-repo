    "author": "64bbce8c9e08a4493219f460",
    "content": "Despite its visually stunning animation and action sequences, Demon Slayer fails to explore significant thematic depth. It primarily focuses on the battle between good and evil, neglecting opportunities to delve into complex societal, moral, or philosophical themes. The absence of deeper thematic exploration prevents it from resonating on a profound and thought-provoking level. So why did I watch it? Inosuke.",

    "title": "Should I play Genshin again?",
    "author": "64bbce8c9e08a4493219f466",
    "content": "Lately, I've been stumbling upon tons of Genshin-related stuff like MMDs, fan comics, breathtaking artwork, and mind-blowing MVs featuring the characters on YouTube. It's rekindling my interest like never before!\n\nTo give you some background, I gave Genshin a shot last year but ended up dropping it because I was also engrossed in playing Honkai Impact (which I still do, by the way). Back then, I thought managing the gacha systems in both games would be overwhelming, not to mention the occasional negativity aimed at Genshin players. However, things have changed for me now.\n\nRecently, I've been bombarded with a flood of amazing Genshin content, and it's making me seriously consider jumping back into the game. The only thing that's giving me second thoughts is the game's free-to-play aspect. How feasible is it to enjoy the game without spending a fortune? Is Genshin Impact worth giving another shot?",

    "content": "Before this season started there was a lot of hype around this show. and tbh, I initially brushed off \"Komi Can't Communicate\" as your rom-com school story, but sheeshhh was I wrong. This show is an absolute masterpiece frfr, the show has its own unique charm. Every episode leaves me with a smile on my face and a light feeling in my heart tlga.
